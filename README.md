# Policy-Cancellation-in-Python
Modelling cancellation of insurance policies using GLM in Python

In this project I attempted to analyse and model cancellation of an insurance portfolio publised on https://www.kaggle.com/ycanario/home-insurance using GLM in Python. I have used the web-based JupyterLab (https://jupyter.org/) as my development environment.
